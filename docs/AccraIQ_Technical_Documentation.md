## 🚌 **The Core Problem: Operational Waste**

### **What is "Operational Waste Without Serving Additional Passengers"?**

This refers to a critical inefficiency where multiple transit routes overlap significantly but don't actually improve service for passengers.

#### **The Wasteful Scenario**

```
❌ CURRENT ACCRA SITUATION:
├── Route A: Tema → Circle (direct, 12.3 km)
├── Route B: Tema → Circle via Labone (12.8 km)
├── Route C: Tema → Circle via Airport (13.1 km)

Resources Required: 3 buses, 3 drivers, 3× fuel, 3× maintenance
Passenger Benefit: Serves same origin-destination pair
Result: MASSIVE OPERATIONAL WASTE
```

#### **The Real Impact**

- **Triple operational costs** for essentially the same service
- **Passenger confusion** from too many similar options
- **Municipal budget waste** on redundant operations
- **Environmental impact** from unnecessary emissions
- **Traffic congestion** from duplicate routes

#### **AccraIQ's Optimized Solution**

```
✅ OPTIMIZED SCENARIO:
└── Route A: Tema → Circle (12.3 km)
    ├── Maintains 92% of original stop coverage
    ├── Eliminates Routes B & C redundancy
    ├── Saves ₵62,400 annually per eliminated route
    └── Same service quality for passengers
```

## 🔧 **The Three-Stage Optimization Pipeline**

AccraIQ transforms the transit network through three mathematically rigorous stages:

### **Stage 1: Route Similarity Analysis (Dynamic Time Warping)**

_"Which routes are doing the same job?"_

#### **Purpose**

Identify routes that are geometrically similar and potentially redundant.

#### **Technical Implementation**

- **Algorithm**: Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with coordinate normalization
- **Input**: GPS coordinates of all 651 routes
- **Process**: Compare every route to every other route
- **Output**: Similarity matrix showing geometric relationships

#### **How DTW Works**

```python
# Route signature extraction
def extract_route_signature(route_geometry):
    # 1. Normalize coordinates to UTM projection
    normalized_coords = utm_transform(route_geometry.coords)

    # 2. Interpolate to fixed number of points (30 points)
    interpolated_points = interpolate_route(normalized_coords, 30)

    # 3. Calculate bearing sequence (direction changes)
    bearings = calculate_bearings(interpolated_points)

    # 4. Create directional histogram
    bearing_histogram = create_histogram(bearings, 12_bins)

    return {
        'coordinates': interpolated_points,
        'bearing_histogram': bearing_histogram,
        'length_m': route_length,
        'start_point': start_coords,
        'end_point': end_coords
    }
```

#### **Composite Distance Calculation**

DTW combines three distance metrics:

- **Geometric Distance (50%)**: Path shape similarity using DTW algorithm
- **Directional Distance (30%)**: Bearing pattern similarity
- **Spatial Distance (20%)**: Endpoint and length similarity

#### **Real-World Example**

```
Route 23: Tema → Circle (direct path)
Route 67: Tema → Circle (via Labone detour)

DTW Analysis:
├── Geometric similarity: 0.82 (82% similar path)
├── Directional similarity: 0.79 (79% similar bearings)
├── Spatial similarity: 0.91 (91% similar endpoints/length)
└── Composite similarity: 0.84 (84% overall similarity)

Conclusion: These routes are highly redundant
```

---

### **Stage 2: Density-Based Clustering (HDBSCAN)**

_"Group the similar routes together"_

#### **Purpose**

Organize routes with high similarity into logical clusters representing the same transportation service.

#### **Technical Implementation**

- **Algorithm**: HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- **Input**: Similarity matrix from Stage 1
- **Process**: Two-pass clustering with noise refinement
- **Output**: Route clusters grouped by similarity

#### **Two-Pass Clustering Process**

**Pass 1: Primary Clustering**

```python
# Main clustering with strict parameters
clusterer = HDBSCAN(
    min_cluster_size=5,      # Minimum 5 routes per cluster
    min_samples=5,           # Minimum 5 samples for core points
    metric='precomputed',    # Use our DTW similarity matrix
    cluster_selection_method='leaf'
)

labels = clusterer.fit_predict(distance_matrix)
```

**Pass 2: Noise Refinement**

```python
# Handle "noise" routes - find micro-clusters
noise_clusterer = HDBSCAN(
    min_cluster_size=2,      # Allow smaller clusters
    min_samples=1,           # More permissive sampling
    metric='precomputed'
)

# Apply to routes that didn't fit in main clusters
noise_labels = noise_clusterer.fit_predict(noise_subset_matrix)
```

#### **Clustering Results Example**

```
📁 Before Clustering: 651 individual routes

📁 After Clustering: ~80 meaningful clusters

Example Clusters:
├── 📁 Cluster 15: "East Legon Commuter Routes" (8 routes)
│   ├── Route 234: East Legon → Osu (direct, 8.2 km)
│   ├── Route 445: East Legon → Osu (via Ring Road, 8.7 km)
│   ├── Route 012: East Legon → Osu (via Liberation Road, 8.9 km)
│   ├── Route 331: East Legon → Osu (direct, 8.1 km)
│   └── Route 098: East Legon → Osu (via Airport, 9.2 km)
│
├── 📁 Cluster 23: "Airport Connector Routes" (12 routes)
│   ├── Route 067: Accra → Airport (highway route)
│   ├── Route 124: Accra → Airport (city route)
│   └── Route 189: Accra → Airport (express)
│
└── 📁 Cluster 45: "Circular City Routes" (6 routes)
    ├── Route 301: Circle → Osu → Labadi → Circle
    └── Route 456: Circle → Cantonments → Osu → Circle
```

#### **Why HDBSCAN?**

- **Density-based**: Finds natural groupings without pre-specifying cluster count
- **Noise handling**: Identifies truly unique routes that don't belong to any cluster
- **Hierarchical**: Creates stable, meaningful clusters at different scales
- **No spherical assumption**: Works with irregular route shapes

---

### **Stage 3: Set Cover Optimization (PuLP)**

_"Pick the best route from each cluster"_

#### **Purpose**

Mathematically select the minimum number of routes needed to maintain service coverage while eliminating redundancy.

#### **Technical Implementation**

- **Algorithm**: Linear Programming using PuLP solver
- **Formulation**: Minimum Set Cover Problem
- **Constraint**: Maintain 92% stop coverage
- **Objective**: Minimize number of selected routes

#### **Mathematical Formulation**

**Decision Variables:**

```
x_r = 1 if route r is selected, 0 otherwise
covered_s = 1 if stop s is covered, 0 otherwise
```

**Objective Function:**

```
Minimize: Σ x_r  (minimize total number of routes)
```

**Constraints:**

```
Coverage Constraint: Σ covered_s ≥ 0.92 × total_stops
Covering Constraint: covered_s ≤ Σ x_r (for all routes r that serve stop s)
Binary Constraints: x_r ∈ {0,1}, covered_s ∈ {0,1}
```

#### **Route Selection Process**

```python
# Build route-to-stops mapping
route_to_stops = {}
for route_id in all_routes:
    stops_served = get_stops_for_route(route_id, gtfs_data)
    route_to_stops[route_id] = stops_served

# Set up optimization problem
prob = pulp.LpProblem("MinimalSetCover", pulp.LpMinimize)

# Decision variables
x = {route: pulp.LpVariable(f"x_{route}", 0, 1, pulp.LpBinary)
     for route in candidate_routes}

# Objective: minimize number of routes
prob += pulp.lpSum(x.values())

# Coverage constraints
for stop in all_stops:
    covering_routes = [r for r in candidate_routes if stop in route_to_stops[r]]
    prob += pulp.lpSum(x[r] for r in covering_routes) >= coverage_required[stop]

# Solve
prob.solve()
selected_routes = [route for route, var in x.items() if var.value() == 1]
```

#### **Selection Example**

```
📁 Cluster 15: "East Legon Commuter Routes" (5 routes)

Route Analysis:
├── Route 234: Covers 45 stops, 8.2 km
├── Route 445: Covers 52 stops, 8.7 km ← SELECTED (best coverage)
├── Route 012: Covers 38 stops, 8.9 km
├── Route 331: Covers 31 stops, 8.1 km
└── Route 098: Covers 41 stops, 9.2 km

Optimization Decision:
✅ Keep: Route 445 (maximizes stop coverage)
❌ Eliminate: Routes 234, 012, 331, 098
📊 Result: 80% cluster reduction, 100% coverage maintained
💰 Savings: 4 buses, 4 drivers, ₵249,600 annually
