**🏆 Hackathon Solution: Ghana AI Hackathon - Public Transport Efficiency Analysis**

An AI-powered optimization platform that transforms Accra's fragmented transit network into a mathematically optimized system using DTW route similarity, HDBSCAN clustering, and PuLP set cover optimization.

## The Problem

Accra's transit network suffers from massive route redundancy - 651 routes with significant geometric overlap create operational waste without serving additional passengers, making it impossible for municipal planners to optimize budgets or reduce congestion.

## Our Solution

**Three-stage automated pipeline:**

1. **DTW Route Similarity** - Dynamic Time Warping with coordinate normalization identifies geometrically similar routes
2. **HDBSCAN Clustering** - Density-based clustering groups similar routes while preserving diversity
3. **PuLP Optimization** - Mathematical set cover optimization selects optimal routes maintaining 92% coverage

## Quick Demo

🌐 **[Live Demo](http://accraiq.guatanga.com)** - Try the optimization dashboard online

```bash
# Install dependencies
./install_dependencies.sh

# Run optimization dashboard
streamlit run app/main.py

# Or deploy with Docker
docker compose up --build -d
```

## Why This Works

Unlike traditional approaches that rely on ridership data, we use **geometric route similarity**
to identify redundancy - similar to how speech recognition compares audio patterns. This reveals
operational inefficiencies invisible to passenger-count-based methods.

## Key Innovation

**Municipal-grade optimization** that eliminates route redundancy while maintaining service quality. Our mathematical approach delivers ₵39M+ in annual savings while preserving 92% of original stop coverage.

## Technical Innovation

- **DTW for Transit** - Application of speech recognition similarity to route optimization
- **Municipal Impact Modeling** - Complete economic/environmental impact quantification
- **Production-Ready** - Docker deployment, PDF reports, executive dashboard

## Results

- **38.9%** route reduction (651 → 398 routes)
- **₵39M+** in annual municipal savings
- **6,049 tonnes** CO₂ reduction per year
- **92%** stop coverage maintained
